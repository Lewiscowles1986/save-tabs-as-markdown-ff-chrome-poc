## Usage

After download / install you should notice a new icon to the right of the address bar ![The icon is of paper with a + symbol in the bottom right](src/icons/icon16.png)

Upon clicking the icon you should see popup window with a text-box with lines of markdown.

Below this is a button "Save as..." which will initiate a download of the contents as plain-text with todays ISO-8601 date in YYYY-MM-DD format, including a markdown extension.

Next to the save button is a link to my website with the text "LC"
